The web development company Bowfin Tech has been contracted by the the Maryland-based pet daycare, boarding, and training company Beechnut Kennels to design a new website to better advertise their offerings and track customer info. Our team is working with Bowfin Tech to create this website and tracking system. More details are given below:
- **Website Design** (sprints 1-2): The customer requires a responsive web design that can support desktop and mobile users. The site must be easily maintainable while following the brand guidelines of the business. The site should direct users to Beechnut's booking system in Gingr and inform users of events hosted created in the company's Google Calendar account using the Google Calendar API. By the customer's request, the website is being created as a WordPress site using the Elementor site builder. Certain site elements (images and company info) have been provided by Beechnut for inclusion in the site, while some general icons have been provided by a designer at Bowfin Tech. Our team's goal is to create a site on behalf of Bowfin Tech, receiving feedback from both the development team at Bowfin Tech and the customer at Beechnut Kennels.
- **Domain Migration** (sprints 2-3): Migrate the existing beechnutkennels.com domain to the new system hosted on WordPress. Must also ensure that all email addresses using the existing domain are unaffected during the migration.
- **User Tracking** (sprint 3): We will use Google Tag Manager to track users.
