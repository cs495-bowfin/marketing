**Jira board:** https://bowfin.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DP/boards/1

## Beechnut Kennels Site

**Staging Site:** https://beechnutkennels.wpcomstaging.com/

The `beechnut-kennels-site` directory contains the HTML exports of the WordPress pages created via Elementor. These files can be generated as follows:
1. Open the file within WordPress (not through Elementor) in your web browser.
2. Right-click the page and click `View page source`.
3. Copy the contents of this HTML file into an HTML document.
4. Use the `prettier` extension in VSCode to format the document with `Shift + Alt + F`.
5. Upload the resulting file to the directory with the name of the page.

_**NOTE:**_ Since the work on the product is being completed and back up on the WordPress site, the commits to this repo do not necessarily reflect the quantity of work done on the WordPress site.
